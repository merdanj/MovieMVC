# MovieMVC
This is asp.net tutorial I am doing right now to learn ASP.NET MVC. 

This is source of tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started

Most of comments in code are just what code does. It was mainly for me. I wanted to check if I understand what I am writing. Even though I am given code which I can just copy-paste, I rewrote it without changing anything yet. When I am done with tutorial, I will give myself freedom to add new things.

If you somehow got here, I would gladly accept criticism on my code. I'm also looking for books I should read if you think there is book that can help me, please tell me.
